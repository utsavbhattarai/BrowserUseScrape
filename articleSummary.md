What is Dark Energy? Inside our accelerating, expanding Universe
 --- 
 The article discusses dark energy, a mysterious force causing the universe's accelerated expansion.  It started with the big bang, followed by a slowing due to gravity, but then, about 9 billion years later, the expansion sped up due to dark energy.  Scientists don't know what it is, but it makes up 68.3-70% of the universe.  Its discovery can be traced back to Henrietta Swan Leavitt's work with Cepheid variables and Vesto Slipher's observation of galactic redshift, leading to the understanding of an expanding universe.  Later, observations of supernovae showed that the universe's expansion was accelerating.  Several theories try to explain it, including vacuum energy, quintessence, space wrinkles, and a flaw in general relativity.  Future missions like Euclid, Roman, and Rubin will help gather more information about dark energy and the universe.  Dark energy is not the same as dark matter.
